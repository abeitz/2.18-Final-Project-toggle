# 2.18-Final-Project-toggle
 Stochastic model of toggle switch designs

 ToggleDynamicModelling.jl defines the stochastic problem of the miRNA-based design
 ToggleModellingTest.jl calls functions in  ToggleDynamicModelling.jl to simulate the system and build relevant plots. 

 ProteinBasedToggle.jl defines the stochastic problem of the TF-based design
 ProteinToggleTest.jl calls functions in  ToggleDynamicModelling.jl to simulate the system and build relevant plots. 

 final_project.m is MATLAB code for solving for stable steady states and evaluating frequency responses.
